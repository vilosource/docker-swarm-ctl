# Docker Control Platform - Work Log

## 2025-07-07

### Session 1: UI Improvements and Multi-Host Dashboard

#### Navigation Spacing Fixes
- Fixed excessive vertical spacing in navigation menu
- Reduced padding from 45px → 15px for better density
- Created separate CSS class `docker-hosts-nav-second-level` for Docker host submenus
- Applied consistent spacing across all navigation levels

#### Database Schema Enhancement
- Added `display_name` field to DockerHost model for UI-friendly names
- Created and applied Alembic migration
- Allows truncation of long FQDN hostnames in UI

#### Multi-Host Dashboard Implementation
**Backend:**
- Created `/api/v1/dashboard/` endpoint for aggregated statistics
- Implemented parallel host statistics gathering
- Added host health overview (healthy/unhealthy/unreachable/pending)
- Aggregated resource counts across all hosts
- Updated system endpoints to support optional `host_id` parameter

**Frontend:**
- Redesigned dashboard for multi-host overview
- Added host status cards with visual indicators
- Implemented aggregate resource statistics
- Created host details table with health indicators
- Added auto-refresh capability (30-second interval)
- Updated container stats display with running/stopped icons

#### UI Enhancements
- Updated login page logo to match main navigation
- Ensured consistent card heights across dashboard
- Improved container stats visualization with icon indicators
- Added proper TypeScript types for custom React components

### Session 2: Backend Refactoring

#### Code Quality Improvements
- Implemented Repository pattern for data access layer
- Created Service layer for business logic separation
- Applied Adapter pattern for Docker client abstraction
- Reduced code duplication with unified `DockerOperationExecutor`
- Simplified WebSocket implementations
- Fixed circular import issues
- Removed temporary "_refactored" file suffixes

#### Design Patterns Applied
- **Repository Pattern**: `UserRepository`, `HostRepository`
- **Service Layer**: `UserService`, `HostService`, `AuditService`
- **Adapter Pattern**: `SingleHostAdapter`, `MultiHostAdapter`
- **Decorator Pattern**: Enhanced error handling decorators
- **Circuit Breaker**: Resilient connection handling
- **Template Method**: Standardized Docker operations

#### Key Refactoring Results
- Reduced container endpoint from 413 → ~200 lines
- Reduced host endpoint from 448 → ~200 lines
- Eliminated ~400 lines of duplicated code
- Improved testability and maintainability
- Better separation of concerns

### Session 3: Volume and Network Implementation

#### Backend Implementation
**Volume Management:**
- Created volume schemas (VolumeCreate, VolumeResponse, VolumeInspect)
- Implemented volume endpoints:
  - `GET /volumes/` - List with multi-host support
  - `POST /volumes/` - Create volume
  - `GET /volumes/{name}` - Inspect volume
  - `DELETE /volumes/{name}` - Remove volume
  - `POST /volumes/prune` - Remove unused volumes
- Added volume operations to DockerOperationExecutor
- Added volume methods to DockerService

**Network Management:**
- Created network schemas (NetworkCreate, NetworkResponse, NetworkInspect)
- Implemented network endpoints:
  - `GET /networks/` - List with multi-host support
  - `POST /networks/` - Create network
  - `GET /networks/{id}` - Inspect network
  - `DELETE /networks/{id}` - Remove network
  - `POST /networks/{id}/connect` - Connect container
  - `POST /networks/{id}/disconnect` - Disconnect container
  - `POST /networks/prune` - Remove unused networks
- Added network operations to DockerOperationExecutor
- Added network methods to DockerService

#### Frontend Implementation
**Volumes Page:**
- Created volume type definitions
- Implemented volume API client
- Built volume list view with:
  - Multi-host filtering
  - Batch selection
  - Delete and prune operations
  - Driver and mount point display
  - Label visualization

**Networks Page:**
- Created network type definitions
- Implemented network API client
- Built network list view with:
  - Multi-host filtering
  - Network property badges (internal, attachable, IPv6)
  - Container connection count
  - Subnet display
  - Safety checks for deletion

#### Navigation Updates
- Added Volumes and Networks to "All Hosts" section
- Updated routing configuration
- Maintained consistent UI patterns

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed circuit breaker method calls in dashboard endpoint
- Corrected async/sync method calls for Docker SDK
- Resolved SQLAlchemy count query issues
- Fixed schema field mismatches
- Addressed WebSocket authentication double-accept issue

### Git Hygiene
- Maintained clean commit messages without AI references
- Properly structured commits with descriptive messages
- Successfully merged code-cleanup-refactor branch to main

## Summary of Achievements
1. **Enhanced UI/UX**: Better navigation spacing, multi-host dashboard, visual health indicators
2. **Improved Code Quality**: Reduced complexity through design patterns and refactoring
3. **Extended Functionality**: Full volume and network management with multi-host support
4. **Better Performance**: Parallel queries, circuit breaker pattern, connection pooling
5. **Maintained Stability**: All tests passing, backward compatibility preserved

## Next Priority Tasks
1. Design kubectl-like CLI architecture
2. Implement CLI command structure
3. Create CLI authentication system
4. Add host context switching
5. Implement core CLI commands
