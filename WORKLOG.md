### WebSocket Real-time Features Implementation

#### Bug Fixes:

1. **Tail Selector WebSocket Disconnection**
   - Fixed issue where changing the tail selector dropdown caused WebSocket to disconnect
   - Separated display tail (UI filtering) from initial tail (WebSocket connection)
   - The select element now uses `displayTail` state variable instead of undefined `tail`
   - WebSocket connection remains stable when users change the number of displayed lines

2. **JavaScript Errors and WebSocket Connection Issues**
   - Fixed "undefined" JSON parse error from ThemeCustomizer in app.min.js
   - Added window.config initialization to prevent theme configuration errors
   - Improved WebSocket connection handling to prevent duplicate connections in React StrictMode
   - Added connection state checks to prevent multiple simultaneous connections
   - Added unmounting flag to prevent reconnection attempts during component cleanup
   - Temporarily disabled app.min.js theme customizer due to persistent errors
   - Note: javascript:void(0) warnings are from template code and don't affect functionality

3. **WebSocket Performance Optimizations**
   - Added 100ms delay before establishing WebSocket connections to avoid React StrictMode issues
   - Optimized uvicorn configuration with WebSocket-specific settings
   - Set WebSocket ping interval to 30s and timeout to 10s for better connection management
   - Note: WebSockets require single-process mode; multiple workers would break stateful connections

4. **Container Stats Monitoring Implementation**
   - Installed Recharts library for data visualization
   - Created useContainerStats hook for WebSocket stats streaming
   - Built ContainerStats component with real-time charts:
     - CPU and Memory usage line charts
     - Network I/O area charts (RX/TX rates)
     - Block I/O area charts (Read/Write rates)
   - Added current stats summary cards
   - Integrated stats tab into ContainerDetails page
   - Implemented data buffering with configurable max data points (default 60)
   - Added byte formatting helpers for human-readable display

#### Completed Tasks:

1. **Backend WebSocket Infrastructure**
   - Created WebSocket module structure in `/backend/app/api/v1/websocket/`
   - Implemented JWT-based authentication for WebSocket connections
   - Built connection manager for handling multiple concurrent clients
   - Added WebSocket routes to main application

2. **Container Log Streaming**
   - Implemented `/ws/containers/{id}/logs` endpoint
   - Added shared log streams to avoid duplicate Docker API calls
   - Created ring buffer system for log history (1000 lines)
   - Implemented broadcast mechanism for multiple viewers per container
   - Added support for follow mode, tail count, and timestamps

3. **Container Stats Streaming**
   - Implemented `/ws/containers/{id}/stats` endpoint
   - Real-time CPU and memory usage calculations
   - Network and block I/O statistics
   - Rate-limited to 1 update per second

4. **Frontend Components**
   - Created `ContainerDetails` page with tabbed interface
   - Built `ContainerLogs` component with:
     - Real-time log display with line numbers
     - Search/filter functionality
     - Auto-scroll and follow modes
     - Log download capability
     - Connection status indicators
   - Implemented `useContainerLogs` hook for WebSocket management
   - Updated container list with links to details page

#### Technical Decisions:

1. **WebSocket Authentication**: Used JWT tokens in query parameters since WebSocket connections don't support custom headers in browsers

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Single Docker log stream per container shared among all clients
   - In-memory ring buffer for instant history on new connections
   - Efficient broadcast system using asyncio
   - Automatic cleanup when last client disconnects

3. **UI Framework**: Maintained Bootstrap consistency instead of introducing Material-UI

#### Challenges Resolved:

1. Fixed import errors for async database sessions
2. Corrected model imports (user vs users)
3. Updated Docker client factory usage
4. Adapted frontend components to use Bootstrap instead of MUI
5. **WebSocket Connection Issues**:
   - Fixed JWT token validation (using user ID instead of username)
   - Resolved Docker connection by mounting socket instead of TCP
   - Fixed async/sync incompatibility by using thread executor
   - Implemented proper resource cleanup and connection limits

#### Key Implementation Details:

1. **Thread Executor Solution**: The Docker Python SDK provides synchronous iterators for log streams. To use these in an async WebSocket handler, we run the log reading in a thread executor (`loop.run_in_executor`), preventing the event loop from blocking.

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Connection limits: 10 per user, 50 per container
   - Reduced ping frequency from 1s to 30s for secondary connections
   - Added 5-minute timeout for inactive streams
   - Proper cleanup of locks, buffers, and streams on disconnect

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Single Docker log stream shared among all viewers of a container
   - Ring buffer (1000 lines) for instant history on new connections
   - Efficient broadcast system using asyncio

#### Production Scaling Considerations:

1. **Traefik Load Balancer Integration (Future)**
   - Native Docker integration with service discovery
   - Sticky sessions for WebSocket connections via cookies
   - Built-in health checks and circuit breakers
   - Automatic HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
   - WebSocket-aware routing without special configuration
   - Rate limiting and security middleware

2. **Multi-Instance Architecture Requirements**
   - Redis Pub/Sub for broadcasting messages across instances
   - Distributed locking for container log streaming (only one instance reads Docker logs)
   - Session affinity to maintain WebSocket connections to same backend
   - Shared state management in Redis instead of in-memory
   - Leader election for singleton tasks (Docker event monitoring)

#### Next Steps:

1. ✅ Implement real-time container stats visualization - COMPLETED
2. Add container exec functionality with xterm.js
3. Create Docker events streaming
4. Implement volume and network management features
5. Design production-ready multi-instance architecture with Traefik

   - Implemented authentication and permission checks (operator level required)
   - Added support for custom commands and working directory
   - Handled terminal resize commands via JSON messages
   - Used binary WebSocket frames to preserve terminal control codes

2. **ContainerTerminal Component**
   - Integrated xterm.js for full terminal emulation
   - Added custom dark theme matching the application design
   - Implemented WebLinks addon for clickable URLs
   - Added FitAddon for responsive terminal sizing
   - Built reconnection functionality
   - Created terminal toolbar with connection status

3. **Integration**
   - Added Terminal tab to ContainerDetails page
   - Enabled interactive shell access to running containers
   - Proper cleanup on component unmount

### Current Development Focus

With WebSocket real-time features completed (logs, stats, and exec), the next priorities are:

1. **Docker Events Streaming** - Global event monitoring for all Docker activities
2. **Volume Management** - CRUD operations for Docker volumes
3. **Network Management** - CRUD operations for Docker networks
