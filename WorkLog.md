   - Responsive design

**Testing:**
1. ✅ **Playwright E2E Tests**
   - Authentication flow tests
   - Container management tests
   - Image management tests
   - User management tests
   - Dashboard tests
   - Profile page tests

#### Partial Implementations

1. ⏸️ **WebSocket Features**
   - Basic useWebSocket hook created
   - WebSocket endpoints prepared but not fully implemented
   - Real-time log streaming not implemented
   - Container exec not implemented

2. ⏸️ **Rate Limiting**
   - SlowAPI configured in requirements
   - Not implemented on endpoints

3. ⏸️ **Advanced UI Features**
   - Container details view (basic)
   - Task progress monitoring (basic)
   - Container stats visualization (data only, no charts)
   - Error boundaries (basic error handling)

#### Not Implemented

1. ❌ **Volume & Network Management**
   - Volume CRUD operations
   - Network CRUD operations

2. ❌ **Backend Tests**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - WebSocket tests

3. ❌ **Advanced Features**
   - Interactive terminal (xterm.js)
   - Real-time event monitoring
   - WebSocket-based log streaming
   - Container exec functionality

#### Key Decisions Made

1. **Architecture**
   - Clean architecture with separation of concerns
   - Service layer pattern for business logic
   - Repository pattern for data access
   - Standardized error handling with custom exceptions

2. **Technology Choices**
   - FastAPI for modern async Python backend
   - React with TypeScript for type safety
   - Zustand over Redux for simpler state management
   - TanStack Query for server state management
   - Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development

3. **Security**
   - JWT with short-lived access tokens (30 min)
   - Refresh tokens with longer expiry (7 days)
   - Role-based access control
   - Audit logging for compliance
   - Docker socket mounted read-only

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Docker Compose for full-stack development
   - Hot reload for both frontend and backend
   - Nginx as reverse proxy from the start
   - Volume mounts for code changes

#### Next Steps

1. **Complete WebSocket Implementation**
   - Real-time container logs
   - Container stats streaming
   - Docker events
   - WebSocket authentication

2. **Add Missing Features**
   - Volume management
   - Network management
   - Container exec
   - Interactive terminal

3. **Improve Testing**
   - Backend unit tests
   - API integration tests
   - Frontend component tests

4. **Production Readiness**
   - Production Dockerfiles
   - HTTPS configuration
   - Database backup strategy
   - Monitoring and logging

## Summary

Phase 1 is functionally complete with a working authentication system, user management, container and image operations, and a responsive UI. The core functionality is implemented and tested with Playwright E2E tests. Some advanced features like WebSockets and volume/network management are deferred to future phases.

The application can be started with `docker compose up` and accessed at http://localhost with default credentials admin@localhost / changeme123.
