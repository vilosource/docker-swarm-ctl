# Docker Control Platform - Development Plan

## Project Overview
A web-based platform for managing Docker environments with a React frontend and FastAPI backend. The platform supports multi-host Docker management with a phased development approach.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Local Docker Host Management ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Core authentication system with JWT tokens
- [x] User management with role-based access control (admin, operator, viewer)
- [x] Container management (list, create, start, stop, remove, logs, exec)
- [x] Image management (list, pull, remove, tag)
- [x] System information and statistics
- [x] Real-time features via WebSockets (logs, stats, exec)
- [x] Rate limiting and security measures
- [x] Background task processing with Celery
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Phase 2: Multi-Host Support ✅ IN PROGRESS
#### Completed:
- [x] Database schema for multiple Docker hosts
- [x] Host management endpoints (CRUD operations)
- [x] Multi-host Docker service implementation
- [x] Host health checking and status monitoring
- [x] Connection pooling and circuit breaker pattern
- [x] Frontend multi-host navigation
- [x] Host-specific container and image views
- [x] Multi-host dashboard with aggregated statistics
- [x] Volume management (list, create, remove, inspect, prune)
- [x] Network management (list, create, remove, connect/disconnect, prune)
- [x] Backend refactoring for reduced complexity
- [x] WebSocket simplification

#### Remaining:
- [ ] kubectl-like CLI tool
  - [ ] Command structure and argument parsing
  - [ ] Authentication and config management
  - [ ] Core commands (get, create, delete, exec, logs)
  - [ ] Context switching for multiple hosts
  - [ ] Output formatting (table, json, yaml)
- [ ] Enhanced security features
  - [ ] Azure Entra ID integration
  - [ ] Per-host access control
  - [ ] Audit logging improvements
- [ ] Performance optimizations
  - [ ] Caching layer for frequently accessed data
  - [ ] Batch operations for multi-host queries

### Phase 3: Docker Swarm Orchestration (Future)
- [ ] Swarm cluster management
- [ ] Service deployment and scaling
- [ ] Stack management
- [ ] Secret and config management
- [ ] Rolling updates and rollbacks
- [ ] Swarm visualizer
- [ ] Load balancing configuration
- [ ] Multi-node coordination

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack
- **FastAPI**: Async Python web framework
- **PostgreSQL**: User, configuration, and host data
- **Redis**: Caching and message broker
- **Celery**: Background task processing
- **Docker SDK**: Docker API integration
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM with async support
- **Alembic**: Database migrations

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18+** with TypeScript
- **Vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management
- **React Router**: Client-side routing
- **Bootstrap/Adminto**: UI theme
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS (future)

### Design Patterns Implemented
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separation
- **Adapter Pattern**: Docker client abstraction
- **Circuit Breaker**: Resilient host connections
- **Decorator Pattern**: Unified error handling
- **Template Method**: WebSocket handlers

### Security Measures
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CORS configuration
- Secure WebSocket connections

## Current Focus
The project is currently in Phase 2, focusing on:
1. Completing the kubectl-like CLI tool
2. Enhancing security with Azure Entra ID
3. Optimizing multi-host query performance
4. Improving error handling and recovery

## Next Steps
1. Design and implement CLI architecture
2. Create CLI command parsers
3. Implement authentication flow for CLI
4. Add context management for host switching
5. Create comprehensive CLI documentation

## Success Metrics
- Sub-second response times for common operations
- 99.9% uptime for critical services
- Support for 100+ concurrent users
- Management of 50+ Docker hosts
- Real-time updates with <100ms latency
